Ushahidi plugins for CEGSS

Inventory Management via SMS is originally based off the SMSAutomate plugin, but it has been changed to keep track of
inventory by automatically creating individual full reports for each item code send in a single SMS message.

Visualizer is a plugin that can be used in conjunction with Inventory Management via SMS, and it creates a chart using 
realtime data that indicates which items have been depleted most frequently. Very simple, but lays the groundwork for 
creating more data visualizations in Ushahidi. It should be upgraded to a better data visualization tool, like D3. 

The rest of the plugins here are forked from existing plugins that just have slight changes to provide additional
functionality with the Inventory Management by SMS plugin.
